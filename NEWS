New in version 2.1.0
- Compatible with Asterisk 1.8.x (input from www.nethemba.com)

New in version 2.0.0
- Preliminary ANSI support.

New in version 1.4.3
- Handling of redirection info/number in REL.
- Support multiple linksets on one E1/T1.
- Fixes to mtp3d interface.
- Setting SS7_TMR variable on incoming calls, using SS7_TMR variable to set TMR on outgoing calls.

New in version 1.4.2
- Minor fixes

New in version 1.4.1
- Fix for dial command CIC parsing.

New in version 1.4
- Support for linkset groups. The config option "group" for a linkset specifies which group a
  linkset belongs to. The dial command is extended to allow dialing to a linkset group, e.g.
  Dial(SS7/group1) where group1 may consist of multiple linksets.
- Handling/rejection of T.38 parameters.
- Dial command syntax extended. Dialing specific CIC is Dial(SS7/linkset:cic-range), e.g.
  Dial(SS7/linkset1:1-10/number) for dialing out on linkset1 on CICs 1-10, or Dial(SS7/linkset1:2/number)
  for dialing on CIC 2.
- Multiple DPC per linkset handling (Dutch ISUP).
- New config parameter for link: iftype, either E1 or T1.

- Support for multiple OPC (opc and dpc configuration settings now allowed in linkset section).
- Support of hardware/driver HDLC and FCS and MTP2 mode.
- New config parameter for link: stp, specifies STP point code.
- Handling of generic numbers in IAM
- Fixes for SCTP/IP
- Support for multiple signaling time slots on one E1 (schannel and sls config parameters)
- New config option for linkset: noa. Specify NOA for called party.

New in version 1.2.1
- Fix bug causing segmentation violation when using some cli commands

New in version 1.2
- Handling of UBA fixed.
- Compensation for problems with "resource temparily unavailable" when doing zaptel i/o.
- New config parameters for linkset: blockin and blockout. Sets initial blocking status for CICs.
- Hardware DTMF support (thanks to Sangoma).
- Dahdi and Asterisk 1.6.x support fixes.

New in version 1.1
- Fixed buffer overflows in config.c.
- Fixed loss of IDLE CICs.
- Fixed segmentation fault when using "combined" attribute for linksets.
- Fixed block/unblock of last cic not possible bug.
- Fixed handling of dial request supporting multiple audio formats.
- Support for STP signalling, see file ss7.conf.template.single-link for config.
- Jitter buffer handling (thanks to Martin Vít, sponsored by www.voipex.cz).
- H324M support (thanks to Klaus Darilion).
- Fixed a bug that could cause one-way audio in some cases where DTMF codes are sent.
- Fixed a bug where receive fifo is no longer being read.
- New configuration parameters for link, rxgain and txgain, specifies gain values.
- New configuration parameter for link, relaxdtmf, specifies whether to use relax dtmf.
- Fixed handling of timeout after received suspend message.
- Handling of Chinese SS7 variant: new variant config parameter for linksets (SS7 or CHINA)
  (Thanks to Lin Miao, lin.miao at domain openvox.cn).
- Fixes to SS7 variant handling.
- Fixed various mutex locking bugs
- The circuit group messages GRS, CGB and CGU are now substituted by a sequence of their
  single CIC counterpart when the configuration parameter grs is set to no for a linkset.
- Dahdi support (preliminary).
- Fixes to the non-group messages for GRS, CGB, CGU.
- FreeBSD support

New in verion 1.0.0
- Compatible with asterisk 1.2.x and 1.4.x.
- MTP stack placed in standalone executable.
- New loadshare config parameter for linksets (None, linkset, combined).
- New combined config parameter for linksets. Linksets having the same combined
  setting and having loadshare=combined share signalling channels.
- New auto_block config parameter for links. When set to yes, the CICs on that link
  are blocked when signalling on the link is lost.
- The schannel entry in link description in configuration file may specify remote MTP stack.
- PDU dump is now in PCAP format, suitable for wireshark.
- Lots and lots of clean ups and fixes.

New in version 0.9
- Major refactoring of source code to support other level 4 protocols
- Dynamic adjustment of audio data buffers during writes -
  this should reduce "write buffer full" problems
- New CLI command: ss7 show channels, same as ss7 linestat
- Initial address message can be broken to IAM and subsequent SAMs
- Fixed crash when executing CLI reset command
- Tested with asterisk version 1.2.9.

New in version 0.8.4
- Fixed crash when T1 expires
- Made check on audio read to detect underruns
- Fixed crash in process_acm
- Changed priority for continuity check thread
- Fixed crash in CLI command block/unblock
- Fixed CLI command output: "Unknown state: 3"
- Listen on cluster socket only when there are other cluster nodes configured
- Port for TCP connection in cluster now configurable
- Use of ast_setstate to report channel state changes
- New per link config options to enable echo cancellation in Zaptel driver
- New CIC hunting policies: sequential low-to-high and sequential high-to-low


New in version 0.8.3
- Fixed propagation of release causes to/from asterisk
- Reply with UEC when receiving messages from unknown peers
- Make t35 value configurable, and action upon timeout
  selectable (Timeout/End-of-pulsing)
- Redirecting number and redirection information are now
  included in IAM when present
- The optional backward call indicators allways has
 'In-band information indication'. If chan_ss7 has not detected
  any other source of in-band information, it generates it
- Enhanced dial command syntax: Dial(SS7/number:redirecting-number),
  allows a redirecting number to be inserted into IAM

New in version 0.8.2
- Handling of suspend/resume

New in version 0.8.1
- Introduced subservice configuration option for linksets.
- Fixed bug that causes crash when received CGU and other circuit group messages
- Fixed bug that causes repeat warning when doing continuity check
- Fixed a problem with the initial alignment procedure
- Tested with asterisk version 1.2.4.

New in version 0.8

- Multiple links with load sharing and MTP changeover
- Multiple linksets and multiple peers
- Multiple hosts (cluster) with failover capability
- Multiple interconnects (TCP/IP) between hosts for redundant communication links
- Additional supported ISUP messages
	- Circuit group unblocking
	- Circuit group unblocking acknowledge
	- Single circuit reset
	- Single circuit blocking
	- Single circuit unblocking
	- Continuity check request
	- Continuity
	- Subsequent address message
	- Sending of address complete message
	- Sending of answer message
- New UI ss7 commands: link status, linestat, cluster {start,stop,status}
- Partial support for continuity check
- Partial support for overlapped dialling (IAM, subsequent SAMs)

The configuration file format has changed, please refer to the different
ss7.conf.template.* example configuration files. It is designed such that
the same file can be used in a multi host setup.
