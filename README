The chan_ss7 module implements SS7 connectivity for Asterisk. Major features
include

 - MTP2 (Q.703) implementation (mostly complete).
 - MTP3 (Q.704) implementation (bare essentials).
 - ISUP (Q.76x) implementation (reasonable subset).
 - Supports Digium E1 (T1 and other zap-compatible cards should be easy to
   add).
 - Supports incoming and outgoing calls.
 - Supports full ALAW audio (ULAW should be easy to add).
 - Facilities for raw MTP2 packet dump, suitable for Ethereal debugging.
 - Open Source (GPL).
 - Supports high call volumes; tested with 120 simultaneous calls, but
   should handle much more than that, depending on transcoding etc.
 - Supports multiple linksets with different DPCs
 - Supports linksets with multiple links.
 - Supports load sharing and MTP changeover.
 - Supports multiple hosts (cluster) configuration with load sharing and failover.
 - Flexible Dial command syntax for SS7 to allow use on linksets,
   e.g. Dial(SS7/linkset1/12345678)

For detailled features, have a look at the NEWS file.
